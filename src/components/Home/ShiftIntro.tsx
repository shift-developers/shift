          SHiFT MasterSessions is a groundbreaking video series that redefines
          what it means to learn from a therapist.
          <span className="mt-5">
            This isn&apos;t theory-heavy, talking-head education. It&apos;s
            something far more powerful. We shatter the illusion of the
            all-knowing expert and pull back the curtain to reveal the untold
            stories of therapists who have faced their own struggles, done the
            work, and now use that hard-won wisdom to guide others.
          </span>
          <span className="mt-5">
            Some of the topics they teach through their personal stories of
            resilience include Trauma, Communication, Imposter Syndrome,
            Burnout, Suicide, and Finding Your Voice. This humanistic approach
            not only provides the insights, awareness, and skills needed to
            shift from a victim mindset to one of empowerment - but reminds us
            that change is possible when we are willing to do the work.
