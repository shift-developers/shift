    question: "What is SHiFT?",
    answer:
      "Featuring MasterSessions led by licensed therapists, SHiFT offers powerful video lessons rooted in real-life experience, emotional insight, and therapeutic practice. Whether you're seeking personal growth, healing, emotional maturity, or greater self-awareness, SHiFT delivers a modern, relatable approach to mental wellness.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this therapy?",
    answer:
      "SHiFT is not a substitute for therapy. It is a therapist-led, guided mental health education experience designed to support and empower your growth journey - before, during, and after therapy.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the online course format?",
    answer:
      "Each MasterSession includes 6 focused video lessons, averaging 10â€“15 minutes each, available on demand so you can learn at your own pace. SHiFT is more than self-guided content - it's a powerful community learning experience. Our livestreams bring members together to learn alongside others on a shared journey, creating connection and meaningful support.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does SHiFT offer real transformation?",
    answer:
      "After each MasterSession, SHiFT guides you on a powerful journey of personal transformation. You'll go beyond passive learning by doing The Work - with thoughtfully designed workbooks that help you personalize each lesson, deepen your insights, build self-awareness, and create the profound internal shifts needed for real, lasting change.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to engage in community learning to participate?",
    answer:
      "Not at all. SHiFT was designed to meet you where you are. If you prefer to go at your own pace, The Vault gives you full access - no pressure to join live sessions or engage in community until (or unless) it feels right for you.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is your refund policy during the beta period?",
    answer:
      "During the beta, we're offering early access to SHiFT at a significantly reduced rate as we build and grow together. Because this is a limited-time opportunity with exclusive pricing, all beta memberships are non-refundable. We recommend exploring our previews and session teasers before joining to make sure it's the right fit for you.",
